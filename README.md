Time Tracking App (Python): This is a python app that I created to replace a time tracking service I was paying for (https://www.hourstimetracking.com/). I use it on a daily basis to keep track of how much time I spend on various activities throughout the day (reading, studying, etc.) and all the data is saved to a csv file (hours.csv) that I can then analyze with R or Python. I run the app through Apple's Terminal. 

Baby Names (R): Takes all of the name counts for Males and Females back to 1880 and provides three outputs from the baby function.
