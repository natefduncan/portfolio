##Time Tracking App (Python): 

This is a python app that I created to replace a time tracking service I was paying for (https://www.hourstimetracking.com/). I use it on a daily basis to keep track of how much time I spend on various activities throughout the day (reading, studying, etc.) and all the data is saved to a csv file (hours.csv) that I can then analyze with R or Python. I run the app through Apple's Terminal. 

##Baby Names (R): 

Takes all of the name counts for Males and Females back to 1880 and provides three possible outputs from the baby function. 
1. input
2. fun (pop_num, pop_prop, ex_num)
3. gender (M, F, both)
4. year (c(start date, end date))

Example: baby(input = "Nathan", fun = "pop_num", gender = "M", year = c(1880,2014))
